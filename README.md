## 🔢 **What Do You Need?**  
Before diving into machine learning, there are a few foundational skills you should acquire, especially in mathematics.

### 📐 **1. Basic Math Knowledge**
For machine learning, you need to have a solid understanding of some key math topics. Don’t worry, you don’t need to be a math expert, but you must be comfortable with these concepts:

#### 1.1 **Differentiation & Integration**  
These concepts form the basis for optimization techniques in machine learning.

#### 1.2 **Matrices & Vectors**  
Understanding matrices and vectors is essential for working with data and applying ML algorithms effectively.

#### 1.3 **11th and 12th Grade Syllabus**  
Make sure you are familiar with the core math topics covered in your 11th and 12th-grade syllabus (excluding chemistry). This foundational knowledge is crucial to understanding advanced ML concepts.
